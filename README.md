A minecraft hack client for 1.12.2

## Disclaimer

As per MCP's license, I cannot upload the full source. By this I mean I cannot upload the Minecraft files I modified. This is not meant for use just yet, as I have so much to learn and fix and do.

So, this is my first Minecraft Hack client, therefore I obviously have no fucking idea of what I'm doing. Therefore, I have taken some code from tutorials. Don't worry - I'm making a dev branch after this where it's actually written 100% by me, structure and everything (and holy shit I need an auto class loader.) Some of the code was taken from [Spyke Hacks](https://www.youtube.com/user/SpykeHacks) over on youtube.
